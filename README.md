# Glenlivet

Glenlivet is an open source project for AWS infrastructures. With everyone touting
"Infrastructure as Code", then surely it can be open sourced and collaboratively
worked on.

Glenlivet covers many architectural best practices in terms of scalability, flexibility,
security, durability and efficiency. It aims to solve these problems once and for all.

Glenlivet is also highly modular. The vpc, networking, logging are all abstracted as
separate components, designed to be reused and avoid duplication.

With these problem solved, templated/scripted and automated, organisations who starts
on AWS no longer has to face the dilemma of either starting an AWS infrastructure
that is primitive, insecure or having to waste paying through the roof for the development
cost of skilled engineers/consultants.

## Provisioning Templates

The easiest way to provision the templates is to sign up to https://app.bitclouded.io/

It takes care of working out all the required dependencies and piping of values from
one template to another.
