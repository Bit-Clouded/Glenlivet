# Glenlivet

Glenlivet is an open source project for AWS infrastructures. With everyone touting
"Infrastructure as Code", then surely it can be open sourced and collaboratively
worked on.

Glenlivet covers many architectural best practices in terms of scalability, flexibility
security, durability and efficiency. It aims to solve these problem once and for all.

With these problem solved, templated/scripted and automated, organisations who starts
on AWS no longer has to face the dilemma of either starting an AWS infrastructure
that is primitive, insecure or having to waste paying through the roof for the development
cost of skilled engineers/consultants.
